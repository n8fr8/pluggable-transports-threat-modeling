# What Are Pluggable Transports?

Pluggable​ ​ Transports​ ​ \(PTs\)​ ​ are​ ​ a ​ ​ generic​ ​ mechanism​ ​ for​ ​ the​ ​ rapid​ ​ development​ ​ and deployment​ ​ of​ ​ censorship​ ​ circumvention,​ ​ based​ ​ around​ ​ the​ ​ idea​ ​ of​ ​ modular​ ​ transports​ ​ that transform​ ​ traffic​ ​ to​ ​ defeat​ ​ censors.
