# Chapter 5: Vulnerabilities and Assets to Protect

\*\* Adversary Goals / Assets \*\*

* Stop it from working

* Detect, Enumerate users, locate users

* Block specific users, sites, content

* Throttling of transport, to make it slow, not blocked

* Specific timing for blocking

* Identiy and access to all PT traffic in order to build more effective filters, find users

* Link people meeting in physical space, through their similar Internet activity

* 
\*\* Attacks / Vulnerabilities \*\*\*

* Your host/CDN censors you to comply with law

* Your host/CDN takes you offline for ToS violations

* DPI: detection of byte sequences, fingerprints; repeating transformations

* Human: Does it look right to a human? Does this look like what it claims to be?

* Subterfuge: Open-source patch submission that introduces backdoor

* Legal compliance: App store or other service blocks or removes app, client for specific region or everywhere due to legal compliance

* Legal action: PT operator required to log, inject data, or otherwise attempt to compromise or enumerate clients connecting to it

* PT relies on certificate authorities installed on client or server machine; CA is compromised, or new malicious CA is added

* DDoS/bot attack on PT infrastructure running up huge $$$ bills

* App that embeds PT doesn't stay updated, causing user to experience service outtage or be exposed to a known bug/vulnerability

* Server PT doesn't update, exposing a user to an outage or a known bug/vulnerability

* Too much success, too quickly \(getting overwhelmed by actual users\)

* State is DDoSing you, but a good number of actual users from that state are also trying to get on. How to differentiate between them?
