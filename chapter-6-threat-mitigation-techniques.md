# Chapter 6: Threat Mitigation Techniques

\*\* Mitigation \*\*\*

- At worse, if a PT is compromised, should only result in blocking

- Thing on top of a PT should handle its own security; PT is NOT a TLS replacement

- Self destructing / hide the PT implementation on the phone to stop reverse engineering

- PT server operator should be audited, vetted, have warrant canary

- PT servers should use full disk encryption

- Diverse infrastructure to combat single point of failure

- Certificate pinning; use self-signed, or other non-CA trust infrastructure

- Don't rely on DNS

- Develop a matrix of connections of adversaries, to detect too much overlap of jurisdiction, adversaries of adversary

- Utilize models / FTE style config to change shape of PT instead of requiring binary updates 

- Utilize hard to block large corporate cloud domains to fetch configurations, data for accessing the next hop

- Provide in-app notice that it is time to upgrade

- Use email, QR codes, chatbots, SMS, other systems for config/bootstrap data

- Fails safe
